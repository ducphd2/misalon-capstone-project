# Installation

1. First install all dependencies by `yarn` and using nodemon to compile all protobuf file if not includes in project by `yarn watch-proto`
2. To run development env: Run each service (api gateway and other services) by each `yarn start:service-name:dev`
3. I am trying to finish the project in time. That is my capstone project in my curriculum
4. Coding time

# Nestjs + gRPC example

> Hello! âœ‹
>
> I have been searching for an example project that utilizes gRPC with NestJS, but I have not been able to find a detailed one. Therefore, I have created this repository to provide an example for using gRPC.
> This project is a simple todo app, and I have implemented gRPC for my microservices. You can find more details about the architecture in the image

> I have three proto file; user,auth and todo proto file. each my microservice service has its own proto file.

#### Logger
